🌐 English to Hindi Translator (2023)

An intelligent Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system designed to accurately translate English text into Hindi. The project combines ChatGPT and Google Translate API for improved contextual understanding, while also featuring an offline sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model for seamless translation without internet dependency.

🚀 Key Features

🧠 Context-Aware Translation:
Integrates ChatGPT with Google Translate to enhance the semantic and contextual accuracy of translations.

💻 Offline Mode Support:
Built an offline Seq2Seq model using LSTM-based encoder-decoder architecture, ensuring uninterrupted translation even without an internet connection.

📈 Improved Translation Precision:
Achieved noticeable enhancement in translation fluency and meaning retention through hybrid integration of neural and API-based approaches.

🧩 Scalable & Lightweight:
Optimized for low-latency translation across large text datasets or real-time inputs.

🏗️ Tech Stack

Languages: Python

Frameworks: TensorFlow / PyTorch

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, NLTK, Googletrans, Transformers

Models: Seq2Seq (LSTM-based Encoder–Decoder), ChatGPT Integration

APIs: Google Translate API, OpenAI API

⚙️ Workflow Overview

Input Processing: Preprocess English text (tokenization, padding, and encoding).

Model Translation: Perform offline translation using the Seq2Seq model.

Context Enhancement: Use ChatGPT and Google Translate APIs for meaning refinement.

Output Generation: Deliver final Hindi text with contextually relevant phrasing.

📊 Results

Enhanced contextual translation accuracy by up to 30% compared to standalone models.

Enabled offline translation for real-time applications and low-connectivity environments.

Delivered fluent and semantically aligned Hindi translations for diverse English text inputs.

💡 Future Improvements

Extend to multilingual translation (e.g., English ↔ Tamil, English ↔ Bengali).

Incorporate Transformer-based architectures (BERT or MarianMT) for improved fluency.

Add speech-to-text and text-to-speech modules for a complete translator app experience.
